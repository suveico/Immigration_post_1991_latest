## Presenting the data




1. First of all check the 4 python scripts inside "src" folder and try to make general sense of what is going on inside
2. Check "data/real" inside are saved plots in png (when running python) - they were autosaved
3. Think about workarounds (variantions you need around the extracted data) in order to put a focus on some specific segments of the data you are interested in presenting
4. Take a look at [this article](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python/) where the author presents all available types of charts and diagrams in matplotlib (almost the same types are in excel and other software with data visualisation capabilities)
5. A data analyst should know it's graphic presentation tools, so in order to understand them better, try answering the next question:
   - Find and name at least one adventage for each type of diagram (bar,line,pie) that was used in this project?
   - Try and pick a few other types of presentation in order to FOCUS more on some ASPECTS of the data you are researching?!
   
   HINT: for example, sometimes "Bars" diagram are a good choice when presenting "racing" values, or concurring values, but they work best in case the diagram is FIRST of all SORTED.
